- [ ] 1.1.3 Section Review, Questions 1,3, 8, 12

      Question 1: How do assemblers and linkers work together?
      - Assemblers change the source code from assembly to machine language and then the linkers combine the files are created
      by the assembler into one executed program. 
      
      Question 3: What is meant by a one-to-many relationship when comparing a high-level language to
      machine language?
      -  one-to-many relationship means one coding instruction in high-level language corresponds to many 
      coding instructions in machine language.
      
      Question 8: Do you suppose type checking on pointer variables is stronger (stricter) in assembly lan-
      guage, or in C and C++?
      - stronger in C and C++ because assembly language mostly do not have type checking on pointer
      
      Question 12: Challenge: Translate the following C++ expression to assembly language, using the example
      presented earlier in this chapter as a guide: X = (Y * 4) + 3.
          mov eax, Y
          mov ebx, 4
          imul ebx
          add eax, 3
          mov X, eax

      Question 2: Why do you suppose translated programs often execute more quickly than interpreted ones?
      - Because the instructions in the interpreted program need to be decoded before execute whereas the instructions
      in translated one are already converted to the original machine language so they can be excuted directly on the
      hardware.
      
      Question 3: (True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each of its instruc-
      tions is decoded and executed by a program written in language L0.
      -  True
      
      Question 10: Statements at the assembly language level of a virtual machine are translated into state-
      ments at which other level?
      - Statements at the assembly language level are translated into statements at the machine language.

      Question 2: 2. What is the decimal representation of each of the following unsigned binary integers?
      
            a. 11111000 = (1 x 2^7) + (1 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) + (1 x 2^4) + (1 x 2^3)
                        = 248
            
            b. 11001010 = (1 x 2^7 + (1 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^3) + (1 x 2^1)
                        = 202
                        
            c. 11110000 = (1 x 2^7) + (1 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) + (1 x 2^4) 
                        = 240
            
      Question 3: What is the sum of each pair of binary integers?
      
            a. 00001111 + 00000010 = 00010001
            
            b. 11010101 + 01101011 = 01000000
            
            c. 00001111 + 00001111 = 00011110
            
      Question 5: What is the minimum number of binary bits needed to represent each of the following
      unsigned decimal integers?
      
            a. 65 : 7 bits
            b. 409 : 9 bits
            c. 16385 15 bits
      
      Question 6: What is the hexadecimal representation of each of the following binary numbers?
      
            a. 0011 0101 1101 1010 = 35DA
            b. 1100 1110 1010 0011 = CEA3
            c. 1111 1110 1101 1011 = FEDB
            
      Question 7: What is the binary representation of the following hexadecimal numbers?
      
            a. A4693FBC = 1010 0100 0100 1001 0011 1111 1011 1100
            b. B697C7A1 = 1011 0110 1001 0111 1100 0111 1010 0001
            c. 2B3D9461 = 0010 1011 0011 1101 1001 0100 0110 0001
